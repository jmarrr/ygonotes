### Rescue-Ace
Hit their Hoister or Hydrant with your Vielers even if they can dodge it with EMERGENCY! however Ash is best on EMERGENCY!. You can potentially end their turn without extender (Diabellstarr) while if you hit Turbulence even if you prevent it to set 4 they can still go for Auroradon line that have 2 interruptions and a pseudo Dimensional Fissure.

Remove Hydrant as much as possible on the field in order for them to unable to use the second effect of their Spells/Traps.

Play around with Preventer in mind when they have Hoister or Impulse and another R-ACE monster on the field since they can summon it when you activate a monster effect.

### Branded
Do not allow them to fusion summon! Their fusion monsters and materials allows them to gain advantage from setting up resources and interruptions. 

Hold Ash for Branded Fusion or Saronir only if branded fusion or branded retribution is already on the grave which helps recover the spell on the grave. Quem is also a great target if the Branded Fusion is dead already to stop the opponent setting up Fallen of Albaz and wants to fusion on your turn.

Use targeting negation effects for Branded Fusion searchers like Aluber and Kitt. Negating Fallen of Albaz even used as a bait is also good given that you have an important monster to protect since they might use it as fusion material. It is not too late to choose to negate Albion the Branded Dragon,Lubellion the Searing Dragon or Granguignol before they can summon Mirrorjade. Quem, Cartesia and The Bystial Lubellion are your last priority. Be careful to use this when there is already Cartesia on the field as it is used for dodging the interruption.

When the monster on the field is only Cartesia and activates its effect it implies that the opponent bricked and you can gamble to negate that effect.

Like VS Branded has a fusion monster that checks column so place your face up cards on the same column already occupied by your opponent.

It is important to remove Fallen of Albaz on the field or grave to shut down majority of their fusion summon targets. You should also remove the relevant fusion monsters that were sent to the grave on the same turn before the end phase.

### Sky Striker 
Striker is really strong when they have 3 or more spells on their grave so you need to prevent it from happening.

You can catch them off guard if you have a way to reduce the Spells to less than 3 by holding your card effect and only chaining it to a relevant Sky Striker Spell so they can't use their extra effect as they planned to. Example a case where they commited for Acesscode and plan to take control one of your monsters if you have something like Mudora/Crow you can chain it to their Anchor and throw them off.

The usual main plan of Strikers is to capitalize the extra draw from Engage to dig a Handtrap which makes their Handtrap ratio high so always do a Handtrap care when playing against them.

They have great recovery especially when Raye is on the grave so don't blindly just attack their Link monster for damage unless you can guarantee a one-kill. Sometimes it is better to leave any Striker Link moster on the field than letting them setup a card for the next turn like Hayate dump or Shizuku search (Recovered from Raye). It is best remove Raye from the grave to slow them down.

The best time to use the Ash is on the second activation of Engage recovered from Kagari other window like Shizuku or first Engage will vary on your card advantage. 

When Striker player uses the Multirole first effect they most likely have a way to break your board or guarantee a multiple Anchor setup so you have to use your relevant effects on before that time to protect your board.

Having monsters or tokens on their main monster zone shuts down all their Striker Spells. Cards like Kaiju and Terrors of the Overrot are supper effective.

Be aware of Linkage as it can surprise one-kill.

### Salamangreat
Salamangreat main threats are [Roar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Roar) and [Rage](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Rage) since they are searchable while all their link monsters doesn't do anything to interrupt you except Heatsoul that can draw a possible Handtrap. Your main priority is to negate [Balelynx](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Balelynx) effect or destroy [Sanctuary]([Roar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sanctuary)) before they use its effect which can heavily disurpt their whole strategy. 

[Phoenix](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Raging_Phoenix) search effect, Second [Wolf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sunlight_Wolf) linked effect and [Gazelle](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Gazelle) are other strong points that you can negate to prevent the search of their main interruption and extenders.

Salad recipes have high Handtrap ratio if you see a [Heatsoul](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Decode_Talker_Heatsoul) pass play around with Hantraps in mind. 

It is nice to place your monster both on front of extra monster zone if your opponent isn't careful with the zones where Wolf down link pointer is blocked already you can prevent Wolf add from grave effect when they use [Wheesel](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Wheesel).

### VS
Be aware of which attributes goes in and out of their hand since they rely on it to use their second effect. It is effective to prevent them from adding monsters to hand which reduce the chance of getting all types they needed to gain their second effect.

When using targeting negation like Imperm/Veiler it is more valuable to hit [Rock of the Vanquiser](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rock_of_the_Vanquisher) than [Razen](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Razen) since they have a way to dodge it with [Burger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Heavy_Borger) or [Caesar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Caesar_Valius).

Be careful about the placement of your cards on the field as there are effects like [Razen](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Razen) and [Pantera](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Pantera) uses columns to interrupts or destroy. It is good to place your monster in front of [Rock of the Vanquiser](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rock_of_the_Vanquisher) or in front of non Razen on the field also the same way to place Spell/Traps at the same column of opponent Spell/Traps to care for Pantera.

Core monsters like Rock of the Vanquiser, Caesar and Burger can only activate on main phase so use your whatever fast effects that would gain you advantage during non Main Phase.

### Purrely
Prevent them to Xyz summon or Summon Noir as much as possible.

They are prone for one-kill and your only chance is when you out the Noir since they have insane recovery from My Friend and Street.

EPurrely's second effect can miss the timing you can use fast effect to chain block Plump to prevent getting 5 materials for Noir or avoid Happiness OTK when it is trying to activate a Happy Memory after Happiness used all attack by effect on monster.

Negating [Lily](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_Lily) effect is more valuable than [Purrely](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_(card)) since Purrely is not once per turn

### Labrynth
Negating [Big Welcome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Big_Welcome_Labrynth) or [Welcome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Welcome_Labrynth) deals a huge blow to their strategy.
 
[Lady's](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lady_Labrynth_of_the_Silver_Castle) second effect allows her to set any devastating normal trap and with Welcome's effect they can search for Cooclock which can make them able to activate it on their turn. This effect can miss the timing so use any fast effect to chain block Lady.

Furnitures are their main set-up and recovery remove them from graveyard or negate their effects when you can!
