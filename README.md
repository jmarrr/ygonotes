### Salamangreat
Salamangreat main threat are [Roar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Roar) and [Rage]([Roar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Rage)) since they are searchable while all their link monsters doesn't do anything to interrupt you except Heatsoul that can draw a possible hand trap. Your main priority is to negate [Balelynx](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Balelynx) effect or destroy [Sanctuary]([Roar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sanctuary)) before they use its effect which can heavily disurpt their whole combo and can force to waste a lot of resources. 

[Phoenix](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Raging_Phoenix) search effect, Second [Wolf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Sunlight_Wolf) linked effect and [Gazelle](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Gazelle) are other strong points that you can negate to prevent the search of their main interruption and extenders.

Given that most of Salad recipes have high Handtrap ratio if you see a [Heatsoul](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Decode_Talker_Heatsoul) pass without your interruptions play conservatively on your turn and expect a lot of Hantraps on their hand. 

It is nice to place your monster both on front of extra monster zone if your opponent isn't careful with the zones where Wolf down link pointer is blocked already you can prevent Wolf add from grave effect when they use [Wheesel](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Salamangreat_Wheesel).

### VS
Be aware of which attributes goes in and out of their hand since they rely on it to use their second effect. It is effective to prevent them from adding monsters to hand which reduce the chance of getting all types they needed to gain their second effect.

When using targeting negation like Imperm/Veiler it is more valuable to hit [Rock of the Vanquiser](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rock_of_the_Vanquisher) than [Razen](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Razen) since they have a way to dodge it with [Burger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Heavy_Borger) or [Caesar](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Caesar_Valius).

Be careful about the placement of your cards on the field as there are effects like [Razen](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Razen) and [Pantera](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Vanquish_Soul_Pantera) uses columns to interrupts or destroy. It is good to place your monster in front of [Rock of the Vanquiser](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rock_of_the_Vanquisher) or in front of non Razen on the field also the same way to place Spell/Traps at the same column of opponent Spell/Traps to care for Pantera.

Core monsters like Rock of the Vanquiser, Caesar and Burger can only activate on main phase so use your whatever fast effects that would gain you advantage during non Main Phase.

### Purrely
Their Xyz monsters have versatile utility to setup or surprise go for one-kill so as much as possible prevent the purrely to Xyz summon. 

The deck is prone for OTK when you out Noir that is only your chance to go for one-kill.

EPurrely can miss timing on their memory attachment effect so you can use speed spell 1 above card effects to block Plump getting fat for Noir or choke Hapiness OTK on their second Happy Memory attachment.

Negating [Lily](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_Lily) effect is more valuable than [Purrely](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_(card)) since Purrely is not once per turn

### Labrynth
 Do not allow [Big Welcome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Big_Welcome_Labrynth) or [Welcome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Welcome_Labrynth) to resolve since that is their main card to snowball with other Labrynth monster effect which makes Ash Blossom on Welcome and using Called by on furniture is super effective than hitting the Arianna search effect.

 [Lady's](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lady_Labrynth_of_the_Silver_Castle) trap setting effect can miss timing so you can use speed spell 1 above card effects to block her.
