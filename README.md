### Purrely
Their Xyz monsters have versatile utility to setup or surprise go for one-kill so as much as possible prevent the purrely to Xyz summon. 

The deck is prone for OTK when you out Noir that is only your chance to go for one-kill.

EPurrely can miss timing on their memory attachment effect so you can use speed spell 1 above card effects to block Plump getting fat for Noir or choke Hapiness OTK on their second Happy Memory attachment.

Negating [Lily](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_Lily) effect is more valuable than [Purrely](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_(card)) since [Purrely](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Purrely_(card)) is not once per turn

### Labrynth
 Do not allow [Big Welcome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Big_Welcome_Labrynth) or [Welcome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Welcome_Labrynth) to resolve since that is their main card to snowball with other Labrynth monster effect which makes Ash Blossom on Welcome and using Called by on furniture is super effective than hitting the Arianna search effect.

 [Lady's](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lady_Labrynth_of_the_Silver_Castle) trap setting effect can miss timing so you can use speed spell 1 above card effects to block her.
